SMiLE-seq Data Analysis Pipeline
===========

Introduction
------
We developed a novel third-generation sequencing platform-based single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) method named SMiLE-seq (single-molecule real-time sequencing of long fragments amplified via transposon insertion). 
This is an pipeline for SMiLE-seq data analysis. 

To avoid name duplication, we renamed our SMiLE-seq as [Smooth-seq](https://github.com/cyang235/smooth-seq).
